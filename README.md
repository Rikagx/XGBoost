# XGBoost

This repositiory includes a ppt from a lightning talk that I gave at a NYC R-ladies event on 6/19/19. The talk was titled "XGBoost: The Excalibur for Everyone! OR How to get XGBoost Up and Running in 5 Steps or Less." 

I have also includes 2 R scripts that show how I trained an XGboost model. One is from the Kaggle Predicting a Pulsar Star dataset https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star and the other is a non-publicly avalable dataset that includes demographic data on individuals and whether or not they have health insurance.
